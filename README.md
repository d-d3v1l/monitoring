# monitoring
ts monitoring 
This the entire code for now. The C# file is the part where I pull the information from Genesis. You will need Visual Studio 2017 or newer
Selenium Web Driver. It could also be build as an .exe, but it depends on the way it will be used

package.json	package-lock.json	detect-errors.js	data.json	are the files I use for nodejs server
custom.js	main.css	index.html is the frontend part what will be displayed on the website
