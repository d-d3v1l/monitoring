# monitoring
ts monitoring 
This the entire code for now. The C# file is the part where I pull the information from Genesis. You will need Visual Studio 2017 or newer
+ Selenium Web Driver.
package.json	package-lock.json	detect-errors.js	data.json	are the files I use for nodejs server
custom.js	main.css	index.html is the frontend part what will be displayed on the website
